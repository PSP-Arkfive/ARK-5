# ARK-5
Next Generation Custom Firmware for PSP and Vita's ePSP.

Main differences with ARK-4:
- Compiled with `latest PSPSDK`.
- Modular project for easier development (`Divide et Impera`).
- `XMBControl` is now a `Core` (mandatory) part of the CFW instead of an (optional) extra.
- `VSH Menu` has been deprecated in favor of `XMBControl`. *
- `Recovery Menu` has been deprecated in favor of `Vanilla Mode` and/or `Despertar del Cementerio`. **
- Code cleanup, refactor, restyling, fixes, improvements, etc.

<br>
<p>* VSH Menu can still be used via <L+R+Select> combo if it is still installed from previous ARK-4 installations.</p>
<p>** Recovery Menu can still be used via <R trigger during bootup> combo if it is still installed from previous ARK-4 installations.</p>
